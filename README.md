# User Authentication API with JWT

- I have created a simple authentication and authorization that supports RBAC(Role based access control)

## Features:
- User registration with bcrypt password hashing.
- Login with JWT generation.
- Role-based access control (Admin/Student).

## Setup:

1. Clone the repo:

    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/project.git
    cd project

2. Install required libraries and dependencies
    
    npm install
    npm install express dotenv bcrypt jsonwebtoken
